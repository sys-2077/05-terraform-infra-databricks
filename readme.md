# Databricks Development Workflow - Phase 1



The Databricks Development Workflow - Phase 1 project focuses on establishing a robust architecture and a streamlined CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) workflow for Databricks development using a dedicated development workspace. The main objective is to create a foundation for efficient and collaborative development practices.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture diagram above illustrates the key components and interactions within the Databricks Development Workflow - Phase 1 project. The main components include:

1. **Development Workspace**:
   - A dedicated Databricks workspace for development activities.
   - Provides an isolated environment for developers to build, test, and iterate on their code.

2. **Version Control System (Git)**:
   - Serves as the central repository for managing code changes and collaboration.
   - Developers create branches, commit changes, and submit pull requests for code review and integration.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
   - Triggers automated builds and tests whenever changes are pushed to the version control system.
   - Deploys validated code changes to the development workspace.

4. **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**:
   - Defines and manages Databricks resources using declarative configuration files.
   - Ensures consistent and reproducible provisioning of the development workspace and associated resources.

5. **Automated Testing Framework**:
   - Includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
   - Validates the functionality and reliability of Databricks notebooks and scripts.
   - Runs tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early in the development process.

By implementing this architecture and CI/CD workflow, the Databricks Development Workflow - Phase 1 project aims to enhance development efficiency, code quality, and collaboration among team members. It provides a solid foundation for iterative development, automated testing, and streamlined deployments, enabling faster innovation and more reliable Databricks solutions.
